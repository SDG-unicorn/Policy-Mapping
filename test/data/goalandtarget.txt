The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.

The European Green Deal is a response to these challenges.
It is a new growth strategy that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, 
with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy 
where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050
and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use.
